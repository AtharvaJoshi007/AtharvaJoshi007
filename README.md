## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### Comprehensive AI Based Interview System
OpenCV â€¢ Tensorflow â€¢ PyTesseract â€¢ Keras â€¢ Spacy
- Level 1: Custom-built OCR technique for resume parsing
- Level 2 & Level 3: Emotion detection using OpenCV and NLP for candidate answer accuracy with text-to-speech and speech-to-text for answer verification 
- Training Neural Networks for Level 2 and 3. Merging all three levels to create a comprehensive AI based interview system

### Real-time Emotion Detection using Computer Vision
OpenCV â€¢ Tensorflow â€¢ Keras
- Real-time Emotion Detection Model: I have developed a sophisticated real-time emotion detection model.
- Custom-built CNN: Leveraging a meticulously crafted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), my model excels in accurately identifying and labeling human emotions from live video streams.
- Fusion of Computer Vision and Deep Learning: By harmoniously integrating computer vision techniques with advanced deep learning algorithms, my model provides instant and precise insights into emotional states.
- Facial Recognition Integration: The model harnesses the capabilities of facial recognition using the Haar Cascade classifier. This robust combination efficiently detects and isolates faces within video feeds.
- Comprehensive Emotion Recognition: Emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise are promptly recognized and classified in real-time.
- Dynamic Visualization: A standout feature of my model is its dynamic visualization. It overlays distinct colored rectangles around detected faces, each color representing a specific emotion. This visual representation enhances both the interpretability of results and the overall user experience.
- Adaptable Across Domains: Designed for versatility, my model seamlessly integrates into various domains, including customer service, entertainment, and mental health monitoring.
- Practical Applications: Whether assessing audience reactions during presentations, elevating user engagement in gaming experiences, to check non-verbal cues of candidates appearing for interviews ,or aiding therapists in evaluating emotional states, my real-time emotion detection model proves to be a versatile and powerful tool.
- Swift Interpretation of Emotions: With the ability to instantly interpret and respond to human emotions, my model provides a statistical analysis of the emotions over the entire duration of the live video.

### Fraud Detection with Highly Imbalanced Data
Pandas â€¢ XGBoost â€¢ SMOTE Oversampling â€¢ PCA
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing on a highly imbalanced Fraud
Detection Dataset [600000: "Not Fraud", 340: "Fraud"].
- Applied Smote Oversampling to increase the number of fraud samples and
improve the F1 Score for fraud detection.
